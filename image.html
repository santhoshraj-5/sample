        The term “good” has relative meanings depending on the person who is defining it. Several qualities can be used to define what constitutes a good person. However, there are certain basic qualities that are used to define a good person. They include honesty, trust, generosity, compassion, empathy, humility, and forgiviness (Gelven 24). <br>

These qualities are important because they promote peaceful coexistence among people because they prevent misunderstandings and conflicts. A good person is fair and just to all, and does not judge people. He or she is nice to everyone regardless of their religion, race, social and economic class, health status, or physical state (Gelven 25). <br>

A good person treats other people with respect, care, and compassion. Respect shows that individual values and views the other person as a worthy human being who deserves respect. Compassion is a quality that enables people to identify with other people’s suffering (Gelven 27). It motivates people to offer help in order to alleviate the suffering of others. A good person has compassion for others and finds ways to help people who are suffering. Showing compassion to the suffering makes them happy. <br>

It promotes empathy, understanding, and support. In addition, good people are forgiving. They do not hold grudges, and let go of the anger that might lead them to hurt others. They think positively and focus their thoughts on things that improve their relationships (Needleman 33). They avoid thinking about past mistakes or wrongs done by others. Instead, they think of how they can forgive and move on. <br>
